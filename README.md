# Ethical-Hacking-Robot
ðŸŽ¯ **The Mission: Build a Real Ethical Hacking Robot**  

The goal is to create a **fully autonomous, mobile security auditing bot** that can:  
âœ… Scan its environment using **AI-based vision & LiDAR**.  
âœ… Detect and track **Wi-Fi & Bluetooth** signals.  
âœ… Map physical spaces and **log security vulnerabilities**.  
âœ… Use **GPS for precise tracking & logging**.  
âœ… Securely send data to a base server over **VPN, Wi-Fi, or 5G**.  
âœ… Support **mesh networking (Meshtastic)** for real-time data sharing.  
âœ… Operate in a **defense mode**, alerting when security threats are detected.
